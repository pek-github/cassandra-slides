This small Java application will fill up
Table 'heart_rate_by_patient_and_time' of Keyspace 'hospital'
with almost 5000 records.

Before running the application, ensure you have created the Table.
CQL scripts accompanying this app, will help you with that :)

The app takes some time to conclude - well, this is 5000 records!

The app does not perform any extensive error checking/handling.
Also, it was tested in a Cluster with a single node.
